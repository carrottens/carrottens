### Hello world 👋
- 👩‍🎓 I have just graduated from Lancaster University French Studies and Computing
- 💼 Now my goal is to find an internship/entry-level job in Software Engineering to have some experience in the industry before choosing what I want to specialize in further in my academic and professional journey.
- 🌍 I am currently particularly interested in _NLP_
- 💻 I have programmed in C++, C, Java, and bits of Python
- 🦚 I guess this is my portfolio?
